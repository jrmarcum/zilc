# Known Issues — environment and project constraints

## KI-1 — Fil-C upstream is Linux-only (2026-09-18)

Fil-C's README: *"Fil-C only works on Linux/X86_64 or Linux/ARM64."* The earlier Darwin and
FreeBSD ports were dropped in favor of a faithful libc. This dev machine is **Windows 11**.
- **Impact:** building or running upstream Fil-C needs Linux. **WSL is NOT permitted on the Windows
  dev machine (IT policy, owner 2026-09-18). Do not propose installing it.** Fil-C work waits for a
  separate Linux machine.
- Upstream publishes **prebuilt releases**, so the LLVM fork never needs building for the
  experiments: `filc-<ver>-linux-x86_64.tar.xz` (v0.685 was published 2026-09-16) at
  https://github.com/pizlonator/fil-c/releases.
- **Reopen condition:** if Windows becomes a zilc target, a Windows syscall/libc layer is new work
  that has no upstream to borrow from.

## KI-2 — `.zig-cache` on exFAT is poisoned after one build (inherited from wazmrt)

D: is exFAT. A `.zig-cache` there builds once, and every later build fails with a bare
`error: Unexpected` until the cache is deleted. **Reconfirmed in zilc 2026-09-18.**
- **Fix:** `ZIG_LOCAL_CACHE_DIR=C:\zig-cache\zilc` (or `--cache-dir`).
- `std.testing.tmpDir` uses `.zig-cache/tmp` **relative to the cwd**, not the configured cache.
  Filesystem tests may need an NTFS cwd:
  `cd C:\somewhere && zig build --build-file D:\…\zilc\build.zig test`.
- In wazmrt this took **four** misdiagnoses (hardware, antivirus, damaged volume) to find. Don't
  re-diagnose it.

## KI-3 — LLVM version skew: Zig 0.16 = clang 21.1.0, Fil-C = clang 20.1.8 (2026-09-18)

The pass is written against LLVM 20's APIs. LLVM 20 cannot read LLVM 21 bitcode, so IR from Zig
0.16 cannot go through Fil-C's clang.

**Workaround (verified at the source 2026-09-18): Zig 0.15.2 is LLVM 20.** Its `CMakeLists.txt`
requires `find_package(llvm 20)` / `clang 20` / `lld 20`. `Findllvm.cmake` rejects anything
below 20 or at 21 and above, and its bundled libc++ is `_LIBCPP_VERSION 200100` (20.1). Fil-C's
`cmake/Modules/LLVMVersion.cmake` is **20.1.8**. Same major version, so the IR is compatible.
Experiments use 0.15.2.

**Owner decision 2026-09-18: we do not port the pass to LLVM 21 ourselves.** When Fil-C moves to
a clang that Zig 0.16.0 covers, the whole repo converts to 0.16.0. **Reopen condition:** Fil-C's
`LLVMVersion.cmake` major becomes 21, checked at every upstream sync (`upstream.md` step 1).

✅ **Superseded 2026-09-18: the whole repo moved to 0.15.2** (owner: "for full compatibility").
The installed binary reports **clang 20.1.2**. When the switch condition fires, **the 0.16 port is
the reverse of that change.** `main.zig` goes back to `std.process.Init`/`std.Io`,
`minimum_zig_version` becomes `0.16.0`, and the Zig API notes in `design-decisions.md` get updated.
