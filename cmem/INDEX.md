# cmem — Portable Project Memory for zilc

This folder is the **authoritative, portable project memory** for `zilc`. It lives inside the
project tree, so it travels with the project (USB drive, clones) and is **committed to git**, unlike
a machine-local `CLAUDE.md`.

**Format:** plain Markdown. One focused topic file per domain, so any single concern can be reviewed
and revised without wading through one giant file. Keep files small and single-topic.

Modeled on the `cmem/` of the sibling project `wazmrt`
(`D:\Programs\_ProgramExamples\Example_Programs\wasmExamples\wazmrt\cmem`), which is the template
for structure and policy.

## 🏁 STATE — 2026-09-18. **SCAFFOLD COMPLETE. Goals set, first milestone agreed, and P1 waits for a Linux machine.**

**Done 2026-09-18, the first session:** scaffold + dual license + staged upstream licenses
(`0.1.0`). A goals discussion settled the first milestone and 3 of 6 open questions (LLVM version,
platform, Zig-first). The whole repo moved to **Zig 0.15.2** to match Fil-C's LLVM.

| gate (all on Zig 0.15.2) | value | note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| version | `0.1.0` | `build.zig.zon` + `src/root.zig` |
| `zig build` | green | CLI `zilc` + static `zilc_runtime.lib` + `zilc.h` |
| `zig build test` | 1/1 | version-string test only |
| `zig build capi-smoke` | green | C client links the runtime via `zilc.h` |
| `zig build baseline` | green | bug examples compiled with plain `zig cc`: **OOB write runs "fine", exit 0** (the bug zilc exists to catch) |
| third-party code | **none incorporated** | license texts staged; ledger EMPTY |

**Toolchain: Zig 0.15.2, for the whole repo** (owner, 2026-09-18). It bundles clang **20.1.2**,
the same major as Fil-C's LLVM **20.1.8**. ⚠️ **It is at `C:\zig\0.15.2\zig.exe`, not on PATH.**
Bare `zig` is scoop's **0.16.0** (kept for wazmrt), and it fails to build zilc. zilc moves to 0.16
only when Fil-C reaches LLVM 21. See `known-issues.md` KI-3.

```powershell
$env:ZIG_LOCAL_CACHE_DIR = 'C:\zig-cache\zilc'
& C:\zig\0.15.2\zig.exe build test
```

### 🎯 NEXT — P1 feasibility milestone, ⏸️ ON HOLD for a Linux machine (owner, 2026-09-18)

**Agreed milestone:** a Zig program plus a C library, compiled through Fil-C's *existing* pass and
runtime, panics correctly on OOB/UAF. It runs on a **separate Linux x86_64 machine at a later
date**, using **Zig 0.15.2** (LLVM 20 = Fil-C's 20.1.8) and Fil-C's **prebuilt release**. Steps and
expected breakages: [`roadmap.md`](roadmap.md) P1. Remaining open questions:
[`design-decisions.md`](design-decisions.md).

### 🔒 Two things to know before touching anything

1. **Fil-C upstream is Linux-only** (x86_64/ARM64), and this dev machine is **Windows 11**.
   🚫 **WSL is NOT permitted here (IT policy). Never propose installing it.** Fil-C work happens
   on a separate Linux machine. See `known-issues.md` KI-1.
2. **D: is exFAT. Set `ZIG_LOCAL_CACHE_DIR=C:\zig-cache\zilc` before any `zig build`.** A
   `.zig-cache` on exFAT works for exactly one build, then fails with `error: Unexpected` until it
   is deleted. This was learned the hard way in wazmrt and reconfirmed here 2026-09-18. See
   `known-issues.md` KI-2.

## Policy (durable — adopted from wazmrt 2026-09-18)

- **`cmem/` is the single home for ALL project memory.** When the owner says "**update the project
  memory**", fold the latest decisions, found bugs, design changes and current state into the
  matching `cmem/` topic file(s), then refresh its one-line pointer in the Files table below.
  Convert relative dates to absolute. Update existing entries rather than duplicating them.
- **`README.md` is NOT project memory.** It is the public, user-facing document. Keep internal
  decision logs and post-mortems out of it.
- **`third_party/LICENSES.md` is the compliance source of truth.** `licensing.md` records the *why*;
  the ledger of actually-reused code lives in `third_party/LICENSES.md`. Keep them consistent.

### The "update the project memory" trigger (binding on every agent)

When the owner says **"update the project memory"** (or "update memory", "record this", "remember
this for the project"), do all of the following:

1. **Revise all relevant `cmem/` files.** Fold in the change, refresh the Files-table pointer,
   convert dates to absolute, and update entries instead of duplicating them.
2. **Sync `README.md` only where the change is user-relevant** (build, usage, status).
3. **If the work produced a transferable METHOD lesson, add it to
   [`best-practices.md`](best-practices.md)** as one bold rule plus a citation to the incident.

### The "adopt upstream code" trigger (binding on every agent)

Before incorporating or adapting code from Fil-C, LLVM or Zig (see `reference-projects.md`,
`upstream.md`), complete the **Adoption Checklist** in `third_party/LICENSES.md`, add a Component
Ledger entry, and update `reference-projects.md`. *Looking at* upstream code is free. *Copying or
porting* it always requires the ledger entry, and code that ends up in the **runtime** also needs
the runtime-linking rule checked.
