# cmem — Portable Project Memory for zilc

This folder is the **authoritative, portable project memory** for `zilc`. It lives inside the
project tree, so it travels with the project (USB drive, clones) and is **committed to git**, unlike
a machine-local `CLAUDE.md`.

**Format:** plain Markdown. One focused topic file per domain, so any single concern can be reviewed
and revised without wading through one giant file. Keep files small and single-topic.

Modeled on the `cmem/` of the sibling project `wazmrt`
(`D:\Programs\_ProgramExamples\Example_Programs\wasmExamples\wazmrt\cmem`), which is the template
for structure and policy.

## 🆕 2026-09-30 — the Zig runtime and other platforms now have a plan (no version bump)

- **Decided (owner):** the Zig-native runtime (P3) is built **on Linux first, checked against
  Fil-C**. Fil-C's pass and checked musl stay fixed; the runtime is swapped one layer at a time, and
  every gate case must match under both runtimes. The pass is **not** ported (`design-decisions.md`).
- **Shipped:** `zilc build --runtime filc|zig`. `filc` is the default; **`zig` is reserved and
  refused** until the Zig runtime is ready for testing. Tests **10/10**, gate **4/4** re-run.
- **Measured:** Fil-C's runtime contract. `libpizlo` exports 294 `filc_*` (pass → runtime), 1,032
  allocator/GC, and 335 `zsys_*` (the OS boundary). Details: `architecture.md` "The runtime contract".
- **Proposed, not adopted:** **P6 — other platforms**. Safe Zig on the major 64-bit OSes, safe C on
  Linux first. Zig's portability covers the runtime, but not the per-OS checked wrappers or a safe
  libc (`roadmap.md` P6, `design-decisions.md` open question #4).
- ▶️ **NEXT, the owner picks:** the **`zsys_write` spike** (`roadmap.md` P3: learns Fil-C's
  internal calling convention and the linking question) or **P4**. ⚠️ Before any runtime code:
  settle open question #3, port vs. clean-room rewrite.
- 🎯 **Goal (owner):** after the initial work, move to the **latest Zig with the least rework of
  the file layout**. Design for it now (`design-decisions.md` invariant 4): keep version-sensitive
  std calls few (about 31 sites today), and remember there are **two Zigs**, the one that builds
  zilc and the one that compiles user code, and only the second is pinned by Fil-C's LLVM.
- 🔄 **Upgrade procedure (owner):** **A** follow Fil-C to the Zig with the matching LLVM (the
  reference) → **B** port to the latest Zig if different, and require identical gate results →
  **C** benchmark comparison between versions. `upstream.md` "Upgrade procedure". The benchmark
  suite doesn't exist yet (`testing.md`).
- 🔖 **Versioning (owner), APPLIED: the version is now `0.15.2-3`**, `<Zig line>-<zilc
  release>` (was `0.3.0`). Spelling verified with Zig's parser (`0.15.2_3` rejected: Zig reads it as
  `0.15.23`). **No 1.0, ever**: only `-N` advances, and **`N` restarts at 1 for every new Zig
  version, patch releases included** (e.g. `0.16.1-1`, `0.16.2-1`). Scheme fully settled
  (`releasing.md`).
- 🧭 **Lines and basis (owner):** the Zig part names the Zig a line is **built with**, not the Zig
  user code needs (corrected the same day; `root.zig`'s constant is now `zig_line`). The
  **reference line** tracks Fil-C's LLVM. Each **latest line** is ported from the newest reference
  release and names it as its **basis** (`0.16.2-1`, basis `0.15.2-100`). Port notes go in
  `cmem/ports/`. ⚠️ There's no release-notes file yet, and `zilc --version` should show the
  user-code Zig and the Fil-C release.
- 🎯 **FIDELITY FIRST, THEN STREAMLINE (owner):** the Fil-C → Zig port first reproduces upstream
  exactly (user-program binaries byte-identical, runtime results identical), and only then optimises
  beyond it, e.g. smaller binaries. At that point byte-identity no longer matters, but identical
  safety-guarantee results always do (`roadmap.md` P3, `design-decisions.md`). ✅ **Scope confirmed
  by the owner: byte-identity means the end user's COMPILED BINARIES**, not the libraries used to
  build them.
- 🧪 **`tests/basics`: 156 correct programs (owner's C + Zig lessons), 2026-09-30 → `testing.md`.**
  **C: 78/78 build and 77/78 run identically under zilc** (the one difference is `abort()` exiting
  133). **Zig 0.15.2: all 78 build and run with plain Zig, but only 24/78 run under zilc**, all
  because of std: **KI-7** raw `syscall` asm (even `std.debug.print`), **KI-8** `__zig_probe_stack`
  in ReleaseSafe (an easy driver fix), **KI-9** f128 helpers, **KI-10** `pthread_join`. Sizes: C
  zilc is 0.86× Zig ReleaseSmall stripped. Zig zilc is 1.26× ReleaseSafe and 4.36× ReleaseSmall,
  stripped. Every zilc program also needs a ~20 MB shared runtime. Licence: CC BY 3.0 via Go by
  Example, test-only, first ledger entry.
- 🔭 **P3 SCOPING STARTED (2026-09-30), on 0.15.2 → `filc-abi.md`.** Fil-C's runtime ABI was
  decoded from post-pass IR, headers and binaries, **not runtime source**. `pizlonated_X` is a
  *getter* returning a **function object**; calls use a fast or generic entry through the thread's
  cc buffers; the header word at `lower−8` holds the aux pointer and object kind. **This reorders P3:
  the shared ABI core is step 0**, before any `zsys_*`. Overriding by linking looks workable (not
  yet run). It's also evidence that a **clean-room** runtime is feasible (open question #3).
  ✅ **Design docs read** (`invisicap.txt`, `gimso_semantics.md`, `Manifesto.md`), closing most
  gaps: the header is `{size, aux}`, aux holds lowers or atomic boxes, `inttoptr` loses capabilities
  across loads and calls, and the **FUGC protocol requires exiting before any blocking call**. So
  KI-7's raw syscalls would also stall the GC. ✅ **Probed:** the pollcheck flag is a byte at
  thread + 8 (mask `0x0E`) → `filc_pollcheck_slow`, and blocking calls are `filc_exit` → syscall →
  `filc_enter`. **The ABI is observed enough to start step 0**, once open question #3 is settled.
  Probes: `tools/p3/`.
- 🛠️ **Fixed 2026-09-30:** **KI-8** (`-fno-stack-check` in every mode: Zig builds under zilc
  50 → 77/78) and most of **KI-7** (raw `syscall` asm → the checked `zilc_syscall` helper: Zig runs
  correctly 26 → **45/78**). Rule recorded: **nothing unsafe is left to chance**
  (`design-decisions.md` invariant 5). **Next for the corpus:** 19 × "cannot write pointer with null
  object", the new top failure.
- 🔒 **STAY ON ZIG 0.15.2 UNTIL THERE IS A STABLE BASE (owner).** A 0.16.0 trial port was
  stopped. Its facts are in `ports/README.md` "Scouting": Fil-C head is still LLVM 20.1.8, latest
  Zig is 0.16.0 (clang 21), and Fil-C ships ARM64 builds.
- 🌿 **One git branch per Zig line (owner), named `v<zig>`:** `main` is the base (the reference
  line), and **`cmem/` is authoritative on `main` only**, with port notes in `cmem/ports/`. The
  first release tag is **`v0.15.2-3`**, and branch **`v0.15.2`** was cut from the same commit
  (local, not pushed). ⚠️ Never create a tag named just `v0.15.2`; it would clash with the branch
  (`releasing.md`).
  Tests **11/11**, gate 4/4 after the change.
- **Loose ends unchanged:** the upstream Debug report (owner files it) and `std.os.environ` (KI-5).

## 🏁 STATE AT PAUSE — 2026-09-23. ✅ **P1 AND P2 ARE COMPLETE (`0.3.0`). zilc WORKS.**

**Read this first; it is the shortest true summary of where the project stands.**

🎯 **One command compiles Zig and C into a binary where memory-safety violations trap at a named
source line** — and it needs **no Zig fork and no LLVM build**:

```
$ zilc build examples/interop/c_caller.c examples/interop/bounds.zig -o interop && ./interop
in bounds ok, sum=6
filc safety error: cannot write pointer with ptr >= upper.
semantic origin:  bounds.zig:13:6: zig_add   ←  c_caller.c:26:5: main      exit 133
```

C allocated the memory, **Zig** overflowed it, and the capability survived the language boundary.

| version | **`0.15.2-3`** | zilc release 3, for Zig 0.15.2 (was `0.3.0`; scheme changed 2026-09-30, `releasing.md`) |

### How it works, in three lines

1. Stock **Zig** emits LLVM IR (`zig build-obj -femit-llvm-ir`).
2. zilc rewrites **two `target datalayout` lines** into Fil-C's dialect (`src/ir.zig`).
3. **Fil-C's clang** runs the GIMSO pass and links. C/C++ inputs go straight to it.

### What was learned that the code does not say

- 🔑 **Fil-C's IR is a two-line dialect, not a different IR.** `ni:0` on address space 0 (which stock
  LLVM refuses on purpose) plus `datalayout_after_filc`. Everything else is ordinary LLVM IR — KI-4.
- 🔑 **Zig's `start.zig` cannot run under Fil-C**: `@ptrFromInt(getauxval(AT_PHDR))` forges a pointer
  from an integer, which InvisiCap forbids outright. zilc generates a C-ABI entry instead — KI-5.
  ⚠️ **`@ptrFromInt` is ordinary Zig used across `std`; every use is a potential trap site.** That is
  P4's problem, and the most likely source of future surprises.
- ⚠️ **A Debug-mode crash in Fil-C's pass is upstream's bug**, reduced from 1,110 functions to 8 and
  written up in `tools/p2/repro/`. **The owner will file it** (owner, 2026-09-23).
- 🎓 **Two wrong conclusions were published in this very file during the day and later overturned**
  ("the cheap route is dead"; "Zig walks off the end of envp"). Both are kept with their corrections,
  in `roadmap.md` P1 step 3 and KI-5. *The failure mode was the same twice: reasoning from one
  unvaried default, and from a function's name instead of its body.*

**Toolchain: Zig 0.15.2, for the whole repo** (owner, 2026-09-18). It bundles clang **20.1.2**,
the same major as Fil-C's LLVM **20.1.8**. ⚠️ **It is at `C:\zig\0.15.2\zig.exe`, not on PATH.**
Bare `zig` is scoop's **0.16.0** (kept for wazmrt), and it fails to build zilc. zilc moves to 0.16
only when Fil-C reaches LLVM 21. See `known-issues.md` KI-3.

```powershell
$env:ZIG_LOCAL_CACHE_DIR = 'C:\zig-cache\zilc'
& C:\zig\0.15.2\zig.exe build test
```

### 🎯 NEXT — **P4: Zig language fidelity** (nothing is blocked; this is a fresh start)

P1 and P2 are closed. The next work is making Zig's *language* safe under the target rather than
just its output: how slices, optionals, `allowzero`, `@ptrCast` and above all **`@ptrFromInt`** map
onto capabilities, and what breaks when real `std` code runs. See `roadmap.md` P4.

**Two loose ends, neither blocking:** the owner files the upstream report when ready, and the entry
shim leaves `std.os.environ` unset (nothing tested needs it yet — KI-5).

**Where to start next session:** `zig build gate` must be 4/4 before anything is believed. Run
`tools/run-gate-wsl.sh`, and read the first line — it prints `SKIPPED` rather than failing when the
Fil-C toolchain is missing.

### 🔒 Three things to know before touching anything

1. **Fil-C work happens in WSL2** (Ubuntu 26.04), under `~/zilc-work/`. ⚠️ **`sudo` needs an
   interactive password**, so install prebuilt binaries into `$HOME` rather than using `apt`. ⚠️
   **Pass shell text to WSL as a FILE** (`wsl.exe -e sh <file>`); PowerShell mangles it inline.
   See `known-issues.md` KI-1.
2. **D: is exFAT. Set `ZIG_LOCAL_CACHE_DIR=C:\zig-cache\zilc` before any `zig build`.** A
   `.zig-cache` on exFAT works for exactly one build, then fails with `error: Unexpected` until it
   is deleted. This was learned the hard way in wazmrt and reconfirmed here 2026-09-18. See
   `known-issues.md` KI-2.

## Policy (durable — adopted from wazmrt 2026-09-18)

- **`cmem/` is the single home for ALL project memory.** When the owner says "**update the project
  memory**", fold the latest decisions, found bugs, design changes and current state into the
  matching `cmem/` topic file(s), then refresh its one-line pointer in the Files table below.
  Convert relative dates to absolute. Update existing entries rather than duplicating them.
- **`README.md` is NOT project memory.** It is the public, user-facing document. Keep internal
  decision logs and post-mortems out of it.
- **`third_party/LICENSES.md` is the compliance source of truth.** `licensing.md` records the *why*;
  the ledger of actually-reused code lives in `third_party/LICENSES.md`. Keep them consistent.

### The "update the project memory" trigger (binding on every agent)

When the owner says **"update the project memory"** (or "update memory", "record this", "remember
this for the project"), do all of the following:

1. **Revise all relevant `cmem/` files.** Fold in the change, refresh the Files-table pointer,
   convert dates to absolute, and update entries instead of duplicating them.
2. **Sync `README.md` only where the change is user-relevant** (build, usage, status).
3. **If the work produced a transferable METHOD lesson, add it to
   [`best-practices.md`](best-practices.md)** as one bold rule plus a citation to the incident.

### The "adopt upstream code" trigger (binding on every agent)

Before incorporating or adapting code from Fil-C, LLVM or Zig (see `reference-projects.md`,
`upstream.md`), complete the **Adoption Checklist** in `third_party/LICENSES.md`, add a Component
Ledger entry, and update `reference-projects.md`. *Looking at* upstream code is free. *Copying or
porting* it always requires the ledger entry, and code that ends up in the **runtime** also needs
the runtime-linking rule checked.
